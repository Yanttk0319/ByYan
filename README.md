IFCM Project

This repository contains the code and data for my research experiments on Individual Fair Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM).

Directory Structure

- dataset 
  This folder contains all the experimental datasets used in my paper.

- new_IFCM_Î².py  
  This is the main code file implementing the IFCM algorithm.

- experience_large_data 
  Contains code for running experiments on large datasets (requires additional design for the largest connected subgraph). The experimental results will be saved as CSV files in this folder.

- experience_small_data 
  Contains code for running experiments on small datasets. The experimental results will be saved as CSV files in this folder.

- Other code files  
  These are auxiliary scripts used for data processing, calculations, and plotting.

 How to Use

1. Select the dataset you want to use by modifying the corresponding code.
2. Run the relevant script (`experience_large_data/large_data_run.py` or `experience_small_data/small_data_run.py`) depending on the size of your dataset.
3. Experimental results will be generated as CSV files in the corresponding folder.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
